# Project Euler Practice (Code + Pseudocode + Maths)

This repository is a learning log for solving problems from **Project Euler**:
https://projecteuler.net/

The focus is not just on getting the correct answer, but on learning how to think clearly and systematically while solving problems.

For every problem, I aim to:
- understand the problem deeply
- break it down logically
- write **pseudocode** before coding
- work through the **math reasoning and calculations**
- implement an efficient and readable solution

## Important note (Project Euler rules)

Project Euler discourages publishing full solutions publicly, as it takes away the challenge for others.

Because of this, this repository:
- does **not** publish final numeric answers
- avoids copy-pasteable full solutions
- focuses on reasoning, approach, and implementation ideas

All results can be verified locally on a personal Project Euler account.

## Repository structure

Example structure (may evolve over time):

```
.
├── problems/
│   ├── 0001/
│   │   ├── README.md          # reasoning, pseudocode, math notes
│   │   └── solution.*         # implementation
│   ├── 0002/
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── solution.*
│   └── ...
├── utils/                     # shared helpers (primes(Prime numbers), gcd(Greatest Common Divisor), lcm(Least Common Multiple), etc.)
├── notes/                     # general math & CS notes
└── README.md
```

## Problem-solving workflow

Each problem follows the same process:

1. Understand the problem statement
2. Start with a naive or brute-force idea
3. Identify math patterns or constraints
4. Write clear pseudocode
5. Implement the solution
6. Check time and space complexity
7. Refactor for clarity or performance

## Running the code

Run the solution for a specific problem locally.

Example:

```bash
# Python example
python problems/0001/solution.py
```

(Adjust commands based on the language used in this repository.)

## What this repo is for

This repository is used to practice:
- algorithmic thinking
- problem decomposition
- pseudocode writing
- mathematical reasoning
